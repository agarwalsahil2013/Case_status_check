# Case_status_check

Hello fellas, Nice to see you here. Let me explain the whole project.

## Introduction
This is the most interesting project I have ever made. I created a **web app** where user needs to register their **phone number** and **receipt number** (use to track OPT application). Once the phone number gets verified through SMS or Phone. User will get instant message about their status of the application. Not only that, user will automatically enrolled in receiving daily update of their application which will directly send to their registered phone number. Here is a link to know more about
[**OPT Case Status Check**](https://github.com/agarwalsahil2013/Case_status_check).

## Deployed Model on Heroku
You can test the model on **Heroku** from this [**link**](https://casestatus.herokuapp.com/). I'm having good time to receive update of my application **everyday at 10:00 a.m.** It's so simple and easy to register your receipt and phone number. Below steps will navigate you to register your application too.
